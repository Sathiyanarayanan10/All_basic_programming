Then repeat the process with the next number, the one after that, etc. Collatz conjectured that no matter where you start, you will always eventually get to the number 1. For instance, starting with x = 3, since 3 is odd, we compute 3x + 1 to get 10. Then since 10 is even, we divide by 2 to get 5. Then since 5 is odd, we do 3x + 1 to get 16. Then since 16 is even, we divide by 2 to get 8. Continuing, we then get 4, 2, and 1, at which point the sequence starts to repeat. Write a program that asks the user for a starting value and then prints out the all the terms of the Collatz sequence, stopping when the a 1 is reached.\n",

    "15. Write the following game. The player starts with 100 points. The program then picks a random number from 1 to 10 and asks the player to guess it. If they guess it right, they gain 100 points. If their guess is less than the number, then they lose 10 points. If their guess is greater, they lose 20 points. After the guess, print out the result of the guess and the player’s amount of points. The computer then picks a new number and play continues in the same way until the player gets to 200 or more points (in which case they win) or 0 or less points (in which case they lose). Print out a message at the end indicating whether the player won or lost.\n",
    "16. Write the following game. The player is given a random multiplication problem to answer. Make it so that the random numbers range from 2 to 99. For each problem, the player gets one guess. If they get it right, the number of points added to their score is the sum of the two numbers in the problem (e.g., if the problem is 7 x 12, they would earn 19 points). If they get it wrong, their score doesn’t change, but they lose a guess. After each problem, print out whether they get it right and print out their score and how many guesses are remaining. The player starts with three guesses. The game ends when the player either wins by reaching a score of 200 or loses by running out of guesses.\n",
    "17. Consider the following game. The player starts out with dollar 50. They have to pick a number from 1 to 10. The computer then picks a random number from 1 to 10. If the player’s number matches the computer’s or if the player’s guess is not in this range, then the player owes the computer dollar 50 and the game ends. If not, the player’s money doubles to dollar 100 and they keep playing. This time the player and the computer pick numbers from 1 to 9, and if their numbers match or if the player’s guess is not in this range, then the player owes the computer all the money (dollar 100). Otherwise, the player’s money doubles to dollar 200 and the game continues, this time with numbers from 1 to 8. This process continues, with the range of numbers shrinking by 1 each turn, until the last turn with numbers only ranging from 1 to 2. If the player’s and computer’s numbers ever match or if their guess is not in the proper range, the game is over and the player has to pay the computer whatever the money amount has gotten to. At any point, instead of guessing a number, the player can type in 0 to quit the game and leave with their current winnings. Write a program that plays this game, printing out after each guess whether the player gets it right or wrong, and how much money they have. Also print out the result of the end of the game. \n",

What will the long term percentage of boys and girls come out to? Ignore the possibility of twins and other complications. Find an approximate answer to this question by simulating 10,000 couples having kids according to this rule. It should count the total number of boys and girls born and return the percentage of girls.\n",
    "22. Consider a while loop that generates random numbers from 1 to 10 until a 6 comes up. Sometimes a 6 will come up right away and sometimes it will take quite a while. For instance, if we print out the numbers that the loop generates, we might see the sequence 2,3,1,3,6 or the sequence 2,1,9,9,2,2,10,8,9,6. We are interested in how long it could possibly take a 6 to come up. Write a program that simulates this by running this experiment 10,000 times times, and reports how long the longest sequence of numbers turns out to be from those 10,000 trials.\n",
    "23. People often try to collect all the items from a set. Suppose we have a set of 100 items that we are trying to collect. The items are sold in packages of 20 items, with all 20 items in each package being different. Write a program that simulates how long it will take until we have collected all 100 items. Do this by randomly generating packages of 20 and adding them to a collection until that collection has all 100 different items.\n",
    "24. Write a program that asks the user to enter two lists. Then sort both of those lists and “merge” them. Merging two lists means that we build up a new list by looping through each of the lists, comparing the current items in the two lists and adding the smaller item to the new list. For instance, if the two lists are [1,4, 5, 8, 10] and [2,3, 7], then the merged list is [1,2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10], which comes from first taking 1 from the left list, then taking 2 and 3 from the right list, then taking 5 from the left list, then taking 7 from the right list, and finally taking 8 and 10 from the left list."
